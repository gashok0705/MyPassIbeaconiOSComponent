# MyPassIbeaconiOSComponent
A generic application which is useful to detect beacons around you. Included background support too. Added Push notifications to denote the user about the beacon status.

This compnent is consuming the Apple's core location framework to get work. 

The app has been designed in a such a way that even if the app is killed, user will get push notifications about the beacon status. Tested and verified in iOS 9.3 running iPad mini.
